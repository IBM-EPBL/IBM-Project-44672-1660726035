Project Objective
The system is proposed with these objectives:
 Enable tracking of the child’s location and capturing of data remotely such as
 To show the child's actual data with reference values.
 Enable sending of notification if the child is out of location or when the device
realizes abnormal conditions/situations.
 To trigger the alarm and enable automatic video recording whenever the

emergency button is pressed. Then, emergency notification along with real-
time video will be sent to and display in the parents' mobile apps.

 Develop a prototype of IoT wearable smart band connected to parents’ mobile
apps so that they can monitor the actual condition of children at anytime and
anyplace.
 The GPS coordinates of the child will be sent to the IBM IoT platform
 Location can be viewed in the Web Application
 A parent can create a geofence in the web application
 The web application will check if the child is inside or outside the geofence
 Notifies the parents if the child goes out of the geofence
